/*
 * A Wireless service provider has three different packages for its customers:

* Package A:  For $29.99 per month 2GB of data is provided. Additional data is $10.00 per GB.
* Package B: For $39.99 per month 4GB of data is provided. Additional data is $5.00 per GB.
* Package C: For $49.99 per month unlimited data is provided.


* This program will calculate a customerâ€™s monthly bill. 
* It will ask which package the customer has purchased and how many GB of data was used. It should then display the total amount due.  The program should recommend which package is the best for the customer.
